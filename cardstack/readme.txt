This theme can be used to build sites in any language that WordPress itself has been translated into, because it only uses pre-translated strings that come with WordPress on the page itself. Make sure you've installed the appropriate WordPress localization and set the language of your site in WordPress' settings accordingly.

Theme configuration in the admin panel is English-only.

This theme handles Featured Images in an unusual way. Such images are not displayed by the theme at all - support for them is included only for use with various third party widgets and plugins.
